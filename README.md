# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
## Project Description
The AirBnB clone is a complete web application which is composed by:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
## The Console
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of the AirBnB.
It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application.
### How to start it 
The console will be started with the following command: ./console.py
### How to use it
The console can be run both interactively and non-interactively
```

Alternatively, to use the AirBnB console in interactive mode, run the 
file `console.py` by itself:

```
 ./console.py
```

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) 
```
To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal 
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```
```
